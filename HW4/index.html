<h1>HW 4</h1>

<h2>1 Theory</h2>

<p>Do the following problems from the text:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A binary tree has <i>n</i> nodes. What is the maximum height of the
	tree?  What is the minimum height? Explain your answers.</li>

	<li>A tree (not necessarily a binary tree) has n nodes. What are the
	minimum and maximum possible heights of the tree? Explain your
	answer.</li>

	<li>4.6</li>
	<li>4.7</li>

	<!--
	<li>Sometimes it is of interest to use hash functions without actually
	wanting to keep a hash table. An example of this is called a checksum. TCP
	(the transmission control protocol, a connection-oriented protocol for
	internet traffic), for example, computes checksums of data. Each packet
	sent contains a payload (the data you think you.re sending) plus some
	control information that includes a checksum of the payload. The receiver
	of the data computes the checksum of the payload as well. If the computed
	checksum disagrees with the received checksum, the data was corrupted in
	transit and is requested to be resent. Explain why this is a form of
	hashing.
	-->

	<li>Following are several hash functions. None of them are very good as
	hash functions.  Explain why they are not good hash functions.
		<ol>
			<li>Hash keys are character strings. The hash function h1(x) computes
				the length of the string.</li>
			<li>The function h2(x) computes a random number r with 1 &#x2264; r
				&#x2264; B, where B is the number of buckets. It returns r.</li>
			<!--
			<li>Recall that files are usually stored on disk in blocks. Hash keys
			are 512 byte blocks of files, some of which are tar archives, which
			(you can check by running tar) typically contain long strings of
			zeroes as padding. The hash function h3(x) considers the byte stream
			as a stream of integers. (So four characters in a row are viewed as a
			32 bit integer, since c1c2c3c4 is really 32 bits arriving as eight
			bits four times. If the length of the file is not divisible by four, a
			few zeroes are appended to make it a multiple of four.) The hash
			function h3(x) computes the sum of these integers mod
			2<sup>32</sup>:
			<blockquote><i>h3(x)</i> = Sum(i)[ <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> mod
				2<sup>32</sup> ]</blockquote>
			<p>where <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> is the i-th integer as described above.
			(Hint: How does changing the position of bytes affect the value of the
			hash?)</p>
			-->
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Design an efficient data structure for representing a subset <i>S</i>
	of the integers from 1 to <i>n</i>. The operations we wish to perform are
	these:
		<ol>
			<li>Select an integer <i>i</i> from the set and delete it.</li>
			<li>Add an integer <i>i</i> to the set.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>A mechanism must be provided to ignore a request to add integer
		<i>i</i> to <i>S</i> in the case where <i>S</i> alrady contains
		<i>i</i>. The data structure must be such that the time to select and
		delete an element and the time to add an element are constant and not
		dependent on ||<i>S</i>||, the size of <i>S</i>.</p>

		<!--
		<p>What if <i>n</i> is not known before the program starts running,
		although it is known to be constant? How does this change your answer?
		(Hint: You may use more than one data structure if it helps you.)
		-->
		
		<p>Analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithms.
	</li>
	<li>Write a procedure (in pseudocode!) to increase the number of buckets
	in a (closed) hash table. Analyze its time and space complexity.</li>

	<!--
	<li>You have a fixed number B of buckets. You never delete things from
	your hash table.  Describe the performance of your hash table under open
	versus closed hashing.  Describe this mathematically if you can, but you
	will receive partial credit for a good non-mathematical description.
	-->

	<!--
	<li>Extra credit: You have a program that uses a set data structure and
	the usual operations on it: Insert, Delete, Membership-Test, Union,
	Intersection, and Difference. Your boss tells you that you must now also
	support the operation Find-Min. Fortunately, you can simply replace the
	file set.py with a new file that implements set operations with the added
	data structure. Design a data structure for sets with Find-Min. Provide
	pseudo-code to explain how to use your algorithm where it differs from
	data structures and algorithms we have seen in class or in the book.</li>
	</li>
	-->
</ol>


<h2>2 Implementation</h2>

<p><i> This is to be done on the CS machines (tux.cs.drexel.edu , or one of 
the lab machines in UCross 151), and submitted using <a 
href='http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~kschmidt/Ref/submit_cli.html'> 
<tt>submit_cli</tt> </a> </i> </p>

<p>For you to do:</p>

<ol>
	<!--
	<li>(Makefile target: <tt><b>problem1</b></tt>) Implement the function
	Delete on a doubly linked list.  Demonstrate it by generating a list of
	integers of length 10, choosing a random number from 1 to 10 inclusive,
	and then calling delete(i) to delete that element.  Print the list before
	the deletion, then print which element you will delete, then print the
	list after deletion.
	-->

	<li>
	<p>The TAs have provided functions <tt><b>get_expression</b></tt> and
	<tt><b>get_next</b></tt> token that tokenize arithmetic expression. The
	first function, <tt><b>get_expression</b></tt>, returns
	<tt><b>True</b></tt> unless it reads a blank line or end of input. The
	second function, get next token, returns <tt><b>False</b></tt> on error or
	end of expression, but otherwise returns the next token, as a string. (A
	token is the next high-level <i>thing</i>  in the expression, like '+' or
	'*' or '4718'. You can see how they work by running the example called
	<tt><b>test.py</b></tt>.</p>
	
	<p>The tokenizer is very simple and can probably be easily tricked into
	doing bad things if you feed it bad input.  In particular, it doesn't
	understand decimal points. It does understand parentheses, the four basic
	arithmetic functions, and positive integers.  We will only test w/valid
	input, as described here.</p>

	<p>Write functions that use the tokenizer to read arithmetic
	expressions:</p>
		<ol>
			<!--
			<li>(Makefile target: in) inorder.py</li>
			<li>(Makefile target: <b>pre</b>) preorder.py</li>
			-->
			<li>(Makefile target: <b>post</b>) postorder </li>
		</ol>

	<p>, each of which expects an expression in the given order. As you read
	the expressions, you should build a parse tree (algorithm follows). Then
	for each of these, it should print the expression, from the parse tree, in
	pre-order, in-order, and post-order. Your program should expect to read
	lines from stdin, much like test.py does.  One expression per line, assume
	that expressions are correct (valid).</p>

	<p>Output would be something like:</p>

	<blockquote><tt>
	<pre>pre:  + 3 2
in: 3 + 2
post: 3 2 +</pre></tt></blockquote>

	<p>for each input expression.</p>

	<h3>Parsing a Postfix Expression</h3>

	<p>Consider a parse tree.  Each subtree is an expression.  We build larger
	expressions from smaller ones.  Leaves are also expressions, simple
	operands.</p>

	<p>So, as you read an operand, wrap it in a single-node tree, and push it
	onto a stack.  When you hit an operator, you will take 2 expressions
	subtrees from the stack, combine them into a larger expressions tree, and
	push that tree back onto the stack.  (Note that the order of the operands,
	as they're popped from the stack, is important.  Try a couple small
	examples using subtraction and division to check your algorithm.)</p>

	<p>If the expression is correct, when you run out of tokens for a given
	expression, there should be exactly one tree left on the stack.  Your
	parse tree for the entire expression.</p>

	<p>Note that you can use almost the same code for all of these, so this
	isn't as hard as it may sound on first reading!</p>
	</li>

	<li>(Makefile target: <i>(No separate target)</i>) <b>Extra Credit:</b>
	In the above exercises, also evaluate the arithmetic expressions and print
	out the answer, so, output from the above targets (for each input
	expression) would look like this:

	<blockquote><tt>
	<pre>pre:  + 3 2
in: 3 + 2
post: 3 2 +
<font color='#990000'>eval: 5</font></pre></tt></blockquote>
	
	<p>Do the evaluation by recursively exploring the parse tree.  That is,
	the value of the expression is the value of the root. The value of the
	root is dependent on the values of its children. And so forth. Since
	leaves are always numbers in our parse trees, their values are the values
	of the numbers represented at the leaves.  You just need to handle four
	operations.</p>

	<p>To convert a string to an int:  <tt>op1 = int( token )</tt>.  This will
	throw an exception if <tt>token</tt> is not something that can be
	converted to an integer.</p>
	</li>

	<li> (Makefile target: <i>view</i>)  Display your source. </li>
</ol>

<h3> Representing Trees </h3>

<p> You can write a simple, dumb class, or you can simply use Python lists
as triplets:  <code>[ <var>Label</var>, <var>Left Child</var>, <var>Right
Child</var> ]</code> . </p>

<hr width='100%'>
<p>We will be supplying our own input files to test with.  We will simply
redirect input, for each given target (so, get the target names
correct!).</p>

<!-- hwrun
<p>To see your stuff run, upon submission, create test target(s) which
explicitly redirect the input, submit some test input files, and provide a
target called <tt><b>run</b></tt> that depends on these test target(s):</p>

<blockquote><tt>run: test_post</tt></blockquote>
-->

<p>A sample makefile, along w/sample input files, has been included.</p>

<p>Here are some files for your use:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a target='260src' href='lexer.py'><tt><b>lexer.py</b></tt></a> -
		functions that will break standard input up, in lines, and each line
		into tokens.  <b>Do not modify!</b></li>
	<li><a target='260src' href='test.py'><tt><b>test.py</b></tt></a> - a
		sample driver, example of using the lexer functions</li>
	<li><a target='260src' href='sample-post.input'><tt><b>sample-post.input
		</b></tt></a> - sample input file</li>
	<li><a target='260src' href='makefile'><tt><b>makefile</b></tt></a> - a
		makefile for you to use.  Shouldn't require much modification (if
		any)</li>
</ul>
